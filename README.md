Logistic Regression:
              Type of Learning: Supervised Learning. This means that logistic regression requires labeled data for training. You need a dataset where the "correct" output (the target variable) is already known for each input.
              Purpose: Classification. Logistic regression is used to predict the probability of a categorical outcome, most commonly a binary outcome (e.g., Yes/No, True/False, 0/1). It can also be extended for multi-class classification (multinomial logistic regression).
Output: It outputs a probability (a value between 0 and 1) that a given input belongs to a specific class. Based on a predefined threshold (often 0.5), this probability is then converted into a class prediction.

How it Works: 
              It uses a sigmoid (or logistic) function to map the linear combination of input features to a probability. The model learns the weights for each input feature that best predict the outcome.
Example Applications:
              Predicting whether a customer will churn (leave a service) or not.
              Determining if an email is spam or not.
              Diagnosing the presence or absence of a disease based on patient symptoms.
              Credit scoring (predicting if a loan applicant will default).


K-means Clustering:
              Type of Learning: Unsupervised Learning. K-means does not require labeled data. It works with unlabeled datasets to discover inherent patterns or groupings within the data.
              Purpose: Clustering. The goal is to group similar data points together into a predefined number of clusters (k). Data points within the same cluster are more similar to each other than to data points in other clusters.
Output: It outputs clusters of data points, with each data point assigned to a specific cluster. It also provides the centroids (mean) for each cluster.

How it Works:
             Initialization: Randomly selects k initial cluster centroids.
             Assignment: Assigns each data point to the closest centroid (usually based on Euclidean distance).
             Update: Recalculates the centroids by taking the average of all data points assigned to each cluster.
            Iteration: Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the centroids no longer change significantly, or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
Example Applications:
            Customer segmentation (grouping customers based on purchasing behavior or demographics).
            Image compression or segmentation (grouping similar pixels).
            Document clustering (grouping similar articles or documents).
            Anomaly detection (identifying outliers that don't fit into any cluster).
Key Differences Summarized:
            Feature	Logistic Regression	K-means Clustering
            Learning Type	Supervised Learning (requires labeled data)	Unsupervised Learning (works with unlabeled data)
            Purpose	Classification (predicts categorical outcomes)	Clustering (groups similar data points)
            Input Data	Requires a dependent (target) variable and independent variables	Only requires independent variables (no target variable)
            Output	Probability of belonging to a class, and a class prediction	Clusters of data points, and cluster centroids
            Goal	To predict a known outcome	To discover hidden patterns and groupings
            Assumptions	Assumes a linear relationship between independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable	Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized; sensitive to initial centroid placement
